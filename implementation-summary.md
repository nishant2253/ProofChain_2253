## Technical Implementation Details

### Commit-Reveal Scheme

Implemented a secure voting mechanism using a two-phase approach:

1. **Commit Phase**: Users submit a hash of their vote, confidence level, and a random salt
2. **Reveal Phase**: Users reveal their actual vote and salt, which is verified against the commitment

This prevents front-running and other manipulation attacks by ensuring votes cannot be known until the reveal phase.

### Quadratic Voting

Implemented a quadratic voting system where:

- Voting power scales with the square root of the staked amount
- This prevents whale manipulation by making vote influence scale sub-linearly with stake
- The system normalizes different token values to USD for fair comparison

### Multi-Token Support

- System accepts multiple cryptocurrencies for voting
- Each token has a bonusMultiplier to incentivize usage of specific tokens
- Token prices are obtained from oracles and cached for efficiency

### Background Processes

- Event listeners continuously monitor blockchain events
- Redis caching reduces blockchain queries and improves performance
- Database indexes optimize query performance for frequently accessed data

## Security Enhancements

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

The application implements a comprehensive Content Security Policy to protect against common web vulnerabilities while ensuring full functionality:

- **Script Security**: Configured to allow scripts from the same origin with necessary 'unsafe-eval' and 'unsafe-inline' directives for blockchain libraries
- **Style Security**: Allows inline styles for dynamic theming and CSS-in-JS libraries
- **Connection Security**: Permits API connections to the backend and other necessary services
- **Media Security**: Configures proper sources for images, including data URIs for dynamically generated content
- **Font Security**: Allows loading of fonts from the application and data URIs

The CSP is implemented via a meta tag in the HTML head:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' http://localhost:* https://*; img-src 'self' data: https://*; font-src 'self' data:;"
/>
```

Key security considerations:

- The more permissive CSP is necessary for blockchain libraries like ethers.js that require eval functionality
- All directives follow the principle of least privilege while ensuring application functionality
- For production environments, this policy can be tightened based on specific requirements
- The policy is designed to balance security with the practical needs of modern web applications

This configuration provides protection against XSS and data injection attacks while allowing the application to function properly with all required third-party integrations.

## Project Structure Cleanup

### Duplicate Source Directory Removal

- Identified a duplicate `src` folder in the project root containing partial implementations:
  - `src/pages/HomePage.js`: Contained only data fetching logic without UI components
  - `src/utils/api.js`: Contained only a response interceptor without complete API implementation
- Compared with the `frontend/src` directory which contained:

  - Complete UI components with proper styling and animation
  - Full API implementation with all endpoints
  - Proper error handling and state management
  - Integration with other components like wallet connection

- Removed the duplicate `src` folder from the project root to:

  - Eliminate potential confusion for developers
  - Ensure all development happens on the complete implementation
  - Maintain a clean project structure
  - Prevent accidental use of incomplete code

- Consolidated all frontend code in the `frontend/src` directory to maintain a clear separation between backend and frontend code

## Version Control & Deployment Optimizations

### Git Configuration

The project implements a comprehensive `.gitignore` configuration to ensure clean repository management and secure deployments:

```
# Dependencies
**/node_modules
**/.pnp
**/.pnp.js

# Testing
**/coverage

# Production
**/build
**/dist

# Misc
**/.DS_Store
**/.env
**/.env.local
**/.env.development.local
**/.env.test.local
**/.env.production.local
**/.cursorignore

# Debug logs
**/npm-debug.log*
**/yarn-debug.log*
**/yarn-error.log*

# Editor directories and files
**/.idea/
**/.vscode/
**/*.suo
**/*.ntvs*
**/*.njsproj
**/*.sln
**/*.sw?

# Temporary files
**/*.tmp
**/*.temp
**/.cache/

# Compiled output
**/*.min.js
**/*.min.css

# Local environment variables
**/.env*.local

# TypeScript
**/*.tsbuildinfo

# Optional npm cache directory
**/.npm

# Optional eslint cache
**/.eslintcache

# Optional stylelint cache
**/.stylelintcache

# Yarn Integrity file
**/.yarn-integrity

# Logs
**/logs
**/*.log

# Backup files
**/*.bak
**/*~

# MongoDB data directory
**/data/db

# Redis dump file
**/dump.rdb

# Blockchain local development
**/.chaindata
```

This configuration provides several key benefits:

1. **Security Enhancement**: Prevents sensitive environment variables, API keys, and credentials from being committed
2. **Repository Size Optimization**: Excludes large directories like node_modules and build artifacts
3. **Conflict Prevention**: Ignores IDE-specific files and local configuration that could cause merge conflicts
4. **Clean Workflow**: Ensures only essential source code is tracked, improving code review processes
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Accounts for system-specific files (like .DS_Store) that shouldn't be shared

#### Environment Variables Management

The project follows best practices for managing environment variables:

1. **No .env Files in Repository**: All `.env` files are excluded from version control to prevent exposure of sensitive information
2. **Example Files Provided**: Each project component includes `.env.example` files with placeholder values as templates
3. **Documentation**: Environment variables are clearly documented in the example files and project documentation
4. **Global Pattern Matching**: The `.gitignore` uses `**/.env*` pattern to catch all environment files in any directory
5. **Local Overrides**: Developers can create local environment files (`.env.local`) for development without risk of committing them

This approach ensures that:

- Sensitive credentials are never committed to the repository
- New developers can quickly set up their environment using the example files
- Different environments (development, staging, production) can use different configurations
- Local development settings don't interfere with team collaboration
